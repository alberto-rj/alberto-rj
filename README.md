👋 Hi, I'm Alberto! I turn designs into accessible and functional web experiences, bridging the gap between what is technically possible and what is humanly necessary.  

### **My Journey**  

My path in programming started with a simple question: *"How can I use technology to make a difference in people's lives?"* As a passionate self-taught developer, I found the perfect answer in frontend development—a blend of logic, creativity, and direct user impact.  

I deeply believe in Vint Cerf’s words: *"The Internet is for everyone, but it won’t be unless WE make it so."* This philosophy guides every line of code I write, every interface I build, and every project I deliver.  

### **How I Work**

My process is guided by three fundamental principles:  

✅ **Clarity above all** – I believe that clean code and intuitive interfaces start with clear thinking. I invest time in understanding the problem before implementing the solution.  

✅ **Continuous learning** – Every project is an opportunity for growth. I turn Frontend Mentor challenges into experimentation labs, where I can test new techniques and refine my craft.  

✅ **Tangible impact** – I measure success not only by technical quality but by the real value I deliver to people. A beautiful interface that no one can use is a failure in my view.  

### **Beyond Code**

When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring design principles and gaming, always looking for inspiration in interactive experiences.  

I’m always open to collaborations and discussions on how we can make the web a better place for everyone. Let’s build something meaningful together!

### 🚀 Currently learning:

- 🌐 Accessibility best practices.
- 🏗 CSS methodologies and architectures.

### ✅ Achievements:

- 🎉 Successfully [completed over 15 projects on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/alberto-rj/solutions), receiving positive feedback and collaborating with fellow developers.
