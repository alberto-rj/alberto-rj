## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

üëã Hi, I'm Alberto! I turn designs into accessible and functional web experiences, bridging the gap between what is technically possible and what is humanly necessary.  

### **My Journey**  

My path in programming started with a simple question: 

> *"How can I use technology to make a difference in people's lives?"* 

As a passionate self-taught developer, I found the perfect answer in frontend development‚Äîa blend of logic, creativity, and direct user impact.  

I deeply believe in Vint Cerf‚Äôs words: 

> *"The Internet is for everyone, but it won‚Äôt be unless WE make it so."* 

This philosophy guides every line of code I write, every interface I build, and every project I deliver.  

### **How I Work**

My process is guided by three fundamental principles:  

1. **Clarity above all** ‚Äì I believe that clean code and intuitive interfaces start with clear thinking. I invest time in understanding the problem before implementing the solution.  

2. **Continuous learning** ‚Äì Every project is an opportunity for growth. I turn Frontend Mentor challenges into experimentation labs, where I can test new techniques and refine my craft.  

3. **Tangible impact** ‚Äì I measure success not only by technical quality but by the real value I deliver to people. A beautiful interface that no one can use is a failure in my view.  

### **Beyond Code**

When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy exploring design principles and gaming, always looking for inspiration in interactive experiences.  

I‚Äôm always open to collaborations and discussions on how we can make the web a better place for everyone. Let‚Äôs build something meaningful together!
